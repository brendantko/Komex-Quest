The game should be fun.

Is it fun yet?

Did you make changes? Where did they go?

I changed things. It's all quite obvious to me anyway.

Ruh roh, looks like we got ourselves a branch. I pulled yesterday, looks like you added Helicopter and such, then i added a sprite and fog of war, then i couldnt commit cause of conflicts.
